# Todo app on svelte

This is a todo app created using svelte.

It is available [here](https://sonus-todo.vercel.app/) for anyone to try.

Currently todos are store locally in the browser. So it can be said all taka remains private and within your pc.

Please keep in mind that this will be updated in future to include cloud storage.

A heartly thanks to Joy, the original creator of this todo app and without whom this project would never have been possible.
